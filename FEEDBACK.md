# Part One - Intro to OO 
Your classes look good. The major piece of feedback I have is around file structure.
Each class should be in its own file, and you want to follow the file structure we'll see later as we build out larger applications: projectfolder/app/models/doctor.rb and projectfolder/app/models/patient.rb
Then you can practice using require_relative to use those classes in a run.rb file
